<p>Hi, my name is Cameron.</p>
<p>This website can be used to save your work. It can also be used to show off your work. At Summit, we use it to save and show off our work and programs. This website is very helpful while doing computer science because it helps us to save our work and add more programs into our portfolio. We can also use this website to show off our work to people. </p>
<p>Links to my work can be found above. </p>
